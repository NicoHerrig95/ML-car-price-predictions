# Car price predictions using ML models :car:  


## Overview
Aim of this project is to built an ML model which is able to predict car prices based on a range of car attributes. The project is based on the [US Used Cars dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ananaymital/us-used-cars-dataset). The code is solely written in Python, using Jupyter Notebook. Besides others, data pipelines and model fitting is mainly done using the **scikit-learn** library.

The final model is based on a Random Forest regressor. 


## Data
The orgiginal data set (which can be accessed through the link above) contains more than 3 million instances. For this project, a subset of the full data set (500 MB) is used due to issues with working memory. The project can, without a problem, be scaled up to the full data set. 


## Code and Scripts
Code for data wrangling, model fitting, parameter tuning and test set implementation is included in the Jupyter notebook (*.ipynb*) file. The notebook is also available as a html version. Further, the executive summary provides a brief overview about the findings and methods used.
